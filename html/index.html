		<h2>First steps</h2>
		<p><i>17/11/2017 - </i></p>
		<p>
			Our first ever meeting occored on the 17th of November 2017, where we introduced ourselves and got to know one another. During this meeting we outlined our individual strengths and weaknesses as well as how we felt they could be best deployed in the form of group roles. We also made it a priority to decide on the group's objective in terms of what kind of app we would develop.
		</p>
		
		<div class="anchor" id="PRODUCT_IDEA"></div>
		<h4>Generating product ideas</h4>
		<p><i>17/11/2017 - 18/01/2018</i></p>
		<p>
			Prior to the first meeting, we agreed on bringing any project ideas to be presented and discussed by the team. The ideas presented were:
			<div class="quote">
				<ul>
					<li>App to teach someone to play a musical instrument (one that can’t play chords)</li>
					<li>App for climbing to find nearby spots, and possibly expand to share climbing achievements on social media and find other climbing enthusiasts</li>
					<li>App to teach children tips and tricks for a device like a raspberry pi</li>
					<li>App to teach someone sign language.</li>
				</ul>
			</div>
			We discussed these ideas at length, outlining advantages and disadvantages in each. After realising there was no clear victor idea, we decided to give in-depth mini-presentations of our favourite ideas at our following meeting (18/01/2018), some of which were new, and have an election to decide. 
		</p>
		<p>
			The final ideas presented were:
			<div class="quote">
				<ul>
					<li>Lab helper app that gives the user useful tools when working with electronics</li>
					<li>App-based cook book</li>
					<li>App-based travel guide.</li>
				</ul>
			</div>
			After a round of voting, there was a clear majority for the cook book idea.
		</p>
		<p>
			Now that we had an idea of what we wanted to do, we were in a position to decide on team roles, and who would occupy them.
		</p>
		
		<div class="anchor" id="POSITIONS"></div>
		<h4>Positions & elections</h4>
		<p><i>18/01/2018 - 23/01/2018</i></p>
		<p>
			Our original set of roles and occupations we decided on the 18th of January were as follows:
			<div class="quote">
				<b>Original Roles:</b>
				<ul>
					<li>Project Manager: Miranda Lowther</li>
					<li>Software Manager: Jack Rookes</li>
					<li>Finance Manager: Miranda Lowther & J&eacute;r&eacute;my S&eacute;rvoz</li>
					<li>Documentation/QA Manager: Alex Fletcher & Marco Bolt</li>
					<li>Design & Specification Manager: J&eacute;r&eacute;my S&eacute;rvoz</li>
					<li>Hardware & Sound Manager: Alex Bennett</li>
					<li>Marketing Manager / Head of Market Research: StJohn Gilbert</li>
					<li>GUI Manager: Kevin Sum</li>
				</ul>
			</div>
			however, upon our next meeting a couple of members were concerned about the work load distribution and other commitments, and so we re-discussed our roles an decided on the final group structure shown in the next section.
		</p>

		<div class="anchor" id="THE_TEAM"></div>

	<div class="text_section">
		<div class="anchor" id="GETTING_STARTED"></div>
		<h2>Documentation Process</h2>
		<p>
			After assigning group roles, we needed to start planning ahead for the project ahead. A slack group was made for all group communications, and a shared online calendar to keep track of deadlines and events.
		</p>
		
		<div class="anchor" id="QA_MANUAL"></div>
		<h4>QA Manual</h4>
		<p><i>01/02/2018 onwards</i></p>
		<p>A thoroughly thought out QA Manual is imperative to the group's success as without it roles and tasks are not properly defined
		and therefore group members will be unable to focus on what is required from them.
		The First Iteration of the QA Manual was edited and compiled by the QA & Documentation manager with all individual group members providing the content
		for their respective sections; not that the Software Manager and QA/Doc Manager created the role definition for Software Engineer.</p>
		<p> As the project progressed it became clear that changes were required; the initial version and the current version of the QA Manual are 
		available 
		<a href="documentation.html#QA_Manual">here</a>
		as well as some notes documenting the changes between the two.
		</p>
		
		<div class="anchor" id="QA_Assessment_Sheets"></div>
		<h4>QA Self-Assessment Sheets 1 & 2</h4>
		<p> Twice during the project, QA self-assessment sheets were filled in by all group members and then reviewed by the QA Manager to ensure that
		work was being conducted effectively with no internal issues. Any points made on these sheets were brought up and discussed in the <a href="documentation.html#meetingminutes">meetings.</a></p>
		<p> The filled in Self-Assessment sheets, template and review document are available on the Documentation page of this website 
		<a href="documentation.html#selfAss">here</a></p></p>
		
		<div class="anchor" id="PROJECT_PLAN"></div>
		<h4>Project plan & projection</h4>
		<p><i>05/02/2018 - 21/02/2018</i></p>
		<p>
			One of the Team Leader's first major tasks was to outline a project plan, outlining the timing and duration of all tasks to be undertaken. These figures would be used in estimating costs, as well as providing a foundational plan to follow to ensure the success of the project.
		</p>
		<p>
			After an initial prediction and cost analysis was completed, team members raised the concern that the hours were far too optimistic, outlining the difference between our predictions and the predictions of other teams. This led to a project plan overhaul, re-estimating the task durations with worst-case scenarios in mind. For comments, see the project overview document of the Team Leader (Marco Bolt).
		</p>
		<p>
			A list of all relevant files is given below.

		<h5> Current Version </h5>
		<p><i>Submitted 21/02/2018</i></p>
		Change Log:
		<ul>

		<h2>Design & specification</h2>
		<p><i>22/01/2018 - 02/02/2018</i></p>
		<p>
			Once the enterprise was set up, it was time to start visualising what our app would look like and how it would behave. As well as providing a template for the software development team, this also had the purpose of enticing investors in our project.
		</p>
		
		<div class="anchor" id="FUNCTIONAL_SPEC"></div>
		<h4>Defining product specification</h4>
		<p><i>18/01/2018 - 02/02/2018</i></p>
		<p>
			From meeting 2 (18/01/2018) we already had a good idea of what we wanted the product to do. A set of basic functionalities were outlined as follows (Taken directly from the meeting minutes):
			<div class="quote">
				<ul>
					<li>The app is a cooking app with recipes available for the user to have access to via a server</li>
					<li>A shopping list will be available for each recipe, and available to be downloaded for when there isn’t an internet connection</li>
					<li>One of the main USP’s of the product is that it displays the recipe instructions/steps in a slideshow format, and that the user can switch between steps in a manner (to be finalised) that would require minimal usage of their hands, which would be useful for many recipes</li>
					<li>The app will have the optional function of also playing a recording of someone reading the recipe steps</li>
					<li>People will be able to add their own recipes, and in future iterations it would be an aim to have affiliates who would sell their recipes (possibly in the form of ebooks) on our app, from which we would make commission.</li>
				</ul>
			</div>
		</p>
		
		<div class="anchor" id="PRODUCT_DESIGN"></div>
		<h4>Product design</h4>
		<p><i>26/01/2018 - 19/02/2018</i></p>
		<p> We started working on the design during the design meeting(26/01/2018), during this meeting we laid down on paper our first ideas for the layout of the app. We drew all the pages we thought we needed for the app thinking about the interaction between them and aiming for easy to use interface.
			<ul>
				<li><a href="Resources\Documents\Design\image1.jpeg">Homepage preliminary design</a></li>
				<li><a href="Resources\Documents\Design\image2.jpeg">Menu preliminary design</a></li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<p> We then used proto.io, an app prototyping service to design the app and the interactions within.

		<h2>Implementation</h2>
		<p><i>12/02/2018 - present</i></p>
		<p>
			Once our [FINANCIAL REQUEST THING] had been approved and the designs and specification were outlined, we were ready to begin development of the app. As outlined in the QA Manual, we deployed an Agile programming methodology, following a series of programmer stories in realising our designs and specifications.
		</p>
		<p>
			Programming technically started on the 15th of January, however that was the Software Manager setting up the project and getting everything ready. Programming actually started gaining momentum after the group Tender presentation. 
		</p>
		<div class="anchor" id="PROTOTYPE"></div>
		<h4>Version 1: Prototype</h4>
		<p><i>15/01/2018 - 16/03/2018</i></p>
		<p>
			The development of the prototype could be split into several sections:
			<ul>
				<li>Server</li>
				<li>Functionality</li>
				<li>GUI</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<p><b>Server</b></p>
		<p>
			The server was written in python utilising the "Flask" microframework. This was a system that would handle basic http requests, and pass information to any connected instances of the app.
		</p>
		<p><b>Functionality</b></p>
		<p>
			The functionality development consisted largely of data handling and management. For the prototype, this included:
			<ul>
				<li>Data handling</li>
				<li>XML Parsing</li>
				<li>Filtering</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<p><b>GUI</b></p>
		<p>
			GUI development saw the generation of the page template files, and code that interfaced with it. The tasks involved in GUI implementation for the prototype included:
			<ul>
				<li>Layout descriptions (XML)</li>
				<li>Activity code (making each page displayable in the app)</li>
				<li>Interfacing with objects on screen</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		
		
		<div class="anchor" id="PWS"></div>
		<h4>Project-wide standards and contracts</h4>
		<p><i>13/02/2018</i></p>
		<p>
			On the 13th of Febuary, representetives of each team gathered to discuss the project-wide standards, and how to define them. These standards would be applied to the presentation tool that would be implemented in each of our products.This process was largely led by Lauren Thomasello and Zak West, snd resulted in an xml schema that would be used when developing presentations.
